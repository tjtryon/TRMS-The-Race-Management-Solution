## üõ†Ô∏è 2025-08-24 Currently Development Update Information

# üéØ Under full development since January 2024, this app is on target to release v1.2 or version 1.3 which will be the last release from the 2025 V1.x codebase with the fully integrated TRMS setup, as well as the free open source MIT Licensed TRTS. 

# üê≥ As of August 2025, we are in the current development of a single click script, which builds, istalls TRMS Server, and configured Docker Containers to host various services.  We have standardized on using either the Docker debian-latest or the redhat/ubi89 as the console server software. The benefits of this will be a quick intall, with a tested codebase, which will allow for Midwest Event Services, Inc. to easily support our users in the event they need any fixes.  We have a standard configuration for a Wordpress database server (physical, virtual or docker - the installs are identical, repeatable and supportable), a standard configuration for a Wordpress web server (physical, virtual or docker - the installs are identical, repeatable and supportable), a standard configuration for a Race Database server physical, virtual or docker - the installs are identical, repeatable and supportable)

# ‚è± We are working on really develiping the richness that goes into the ALWAYS-FREE TRTS: The Race Timing Solution. This includes a new timing clock application that syncs the start time from the database, and hosts a full screen monitor (or HDMI TV) standard configuration for a timing apps system, either a laptop or computer that will be the actual scoring apps server. 

# We also have a case for a single All-in-on, laptop or NUC mini-pc and monitor, that will ack as a timing clock synced to the race clock, another single All-in-1, laptop or NIC mini-pc and monitor, for a timing point about 50 meters from the finish line, so that we can kinow and announce for "Everyone put your hands together for John Smith, from Carmel, Indiana. John is currently in 3rd place in his age group. Put your hands together for John, as he crosses thw finish line.   

# In Q3, we have been developing Containers Docker & Kubernatis with monitoring the servers/services.Additionally, we can host your Wordpress DB, Wordpress Web and your PostgresSQL Race Database instances in the cloud. That would leave you will a local intall for TRTS: The Race Timing Solution for raceday tiing apps, which include the RFID Polling service, the race timing clock, the race timing application GUI and the Announcer application.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: GUI Launcher (Recommended)

1. **Install GTK4 dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt install python3-gi python3-gi-cairo gir1.2-gtk-4.0 gir1.2-adw-1
   
   # Fedora
   sudo dnf install python3-gobject gtk4 libadwaita
   
   # macOS
   brew install pygobject3 gtk4 libadwaita
   ```

2. **Setup TRMS**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x TRMS_Complete_Setup.sh
   ./TRMS_Complete_Setup.sh
   ```

3. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch the GTK4 GUI** (supports both Wayland and X11):
   ```bash
   # Auto-detect display server (recommended)
   ./trms_launcher_gui.py
   
   # Force Wayland
   GDK_BACKEND=wayland ./trms_launcher_gui.py
   
   # Force X11 (fallback)
   GDK_BACKEND=x11 ./trms_launcher_gui.py
   ```

### Option 2: Console Launcher

```bash
# Use console-based launcher
./trms_launcher.sh

# Or launch individual components
./run_trrs_console.sh    # Registration console
./run_trts_console.sh    # Timing console
```

## üñºÔ∏è Interfaces

### GTK4 GUI Launcher (NEW!)
- **Modern graphical interface** for managing all TRMS components
- **Real-time status monitoring** of all services
- **Integrated console output** for debugging
- **One-click launching** of all applications
- See [GTK4_GUI_README.md](GTK4_GUI_README.md) for details

### Console Applications
- **Text-based interfaces** for terminal users
- **Scriptable operations** for automation
- **Lightweight** and fast

## üìã Components

### TRRS: The Race Registration Solution
- **Console**: `./run_trrs_console.sh`
- **GUI**: Via GTK4 launcher
- **Features**: Race management, participant registration, payment processing

### TRTS: The Race Timing Solution
- **Console**: `./run_trts_console.sh`
- **GUI**: Available (from GitHub repository)
- **Features**: Race timing, chip timing, results processing

### TRWS: The Race Web Solution

- **Cloud/local database** support with automatic failover
- **Centralized logging** and configuration management

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Configuration

TRMS supports both **cloud** and **local** databases with automatic failover:

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Local database (default)

export DB_PASSWORD=your_password

# Cloud database (optional)
export CLOUD_DB_HOST=your.cloud.host
export USE_CLOUD_DB=true

# General settings

## üîß Troubleshooting

### GTK4 GUI Issues
- Ensure GTK4 and libadwaita are installed
- Check PyGObject installation: `python3 -c "import gi"`
- **Wayland** (modern Linux): Check `echo $WAYLAND_DISPLAY`
- **X11** (legacy/fallback): Set `export DISPLAY=:0` for SSH
- Force backend if needed: `GDK_BACKEND=wayland` or `GDK_BACKEND=x11`
- See [GTK4_GUI_README.md](GTK4_GUI_README.md) for more

### Database Connection Issues
- Check environment variables
- Verify database is running
- Check network connectivity for cloud databases
- Review logs in `TRDS/logs/`

### Python Path Issues
- Ensure you're in TRMS base directory
- Check virtual environment activation
- Verify TRMS_BASE environment variable

### Missing TRTS
